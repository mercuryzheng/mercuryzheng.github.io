Hi, this is Yueyuan (Mercury) Zheng, a research assistant professor in the Division of Social Science at Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST). I received my Ph.D. degree in cognitive psychology supervised by Prof. [Janet Hsiao](https://jhhsiao.people.ust.hk/index.html) at the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.hku.hk/), [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) in 2024.  
  
For more information, check out my [CV](https://mercuryzheng.github.io/files/yz_cv.pdf) here.  

### Research interests  
I am interested in understanding how humans perceive and respond to the world using behavioral, eye-tracking, and computational approaches. For example, I investigate how multimodal information influences human visual strategies and further contributes to their behavioral performance (in scenarios such as multimedia learning and audiovisual emotion perception). I also try to simulate human perception and cognition using artificial neural networks to better understand patterns and mechanisms of human behaviors.
