<span style="color:#6A5ACD; font-weight:bold">I am looking for a post-doc position in the field of (computational) cognitive science in 2024-2025 :)! </span>  
  
Hi, this is Yueyuan (Mercury) Zheng. I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student in cognitive psychology supervised by Dr [Janet Hsiao](http://abc.psy.hku.hk/janet/) at the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.hku.hk/), [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I obtained my MPhil degree in cognitive psychology supervised by Dr [Janet Hsiao](http://abc.psy.hku.hk/janet/) and Bachelor degree in Psychology at [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) in 2021 and 2018, respectively.  
  
For more information, check out my [CV](https://mercuryzheng.github.io/files/yz_cv.pdf) here.  

### Research interests  
I am interested in understanding how humans perceive and respond to the world using behavioral, eye-tracking, and computational approaches. For example, I investigate how multimodal information influences human visual strategies and further contributes to their behavioral performance (in scenarios such as multimedia learning and audiovisual emotion perception). I also try to simulate human perception and cognition using artificial neural networks to better understand patterns and mechanisms of human behaviors.  
  
**Keywords**: Visual Cognition, Science of Learning, Emotion, Computational Modeling.
