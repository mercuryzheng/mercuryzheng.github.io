Hello! This is Mercury Zheng! I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student in cognitive psychology supervised by Dr [Janet Hsiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Cpnk91sAAAAJ) at the Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong. I obtained my MPhil degree in cognitive psychology supervised by Dr [Janet Hsiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Cpnk91sAAAAJ) and Bechalor degree in Psychology at the University of Hong Kong in 2021 and 2018, respectively.

My research interests include visual cognition, science of learning and computational modeling.\
More specifically, I am interested in how multimodal information can guide people's eye movement strategies when doing various tasks, such as in multimedia learning, emotion recognition and face recognition. I would like to simulate human cognition using computationa modeling to better understand the patterns and mechenisms of human behaviors. In addition, I am also interested in neural representations underlying those effects.
