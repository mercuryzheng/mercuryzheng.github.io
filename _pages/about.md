Hi, this is Yueyuan (Mercury) Zheng. I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student in cognitive psychology supervised by Dr [Janet Hsiao](http://abc.psy.hku.hk/janet/) at the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.hku.hk/), University of Hong Kong. I obtained my MPhil degree in cognitive psychology supervised by Dr [Janet Hsiao](http://abc.psy.hku.hk/janet/) and Bachelor degree in Psychology at the University of Hong Kong in 2021 and 2018, respectively.

### Research interests  
I am interested in understanding how humans perceive and respond to the world using behavioral, eye-tracking, and computational approaches. I also simulate human cognition using artificial neural networks to better understand the patterns and mechanisms of human behaviors. 
Keywords: Visual Cognition, Science of Learning, Emotion, Computational Modeling.
