### Overview

\
Hello! This is Yueyuan (Mercury) Zheng! I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student in cognitive psychology supervised by Dr [Janet Hsiao](http://abc.psy.hku.hk/janet/) at the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.hku.hk/), University of Hong Kong. I obtained my MPhil degree in cognitive psychology supervised by Dr [Janet Hsiao](http://abc.psy.hku.hk/janet/) and Bachelor degree in Psychology at the University of Hong Kong in 2021 and 2018, respectively.
\
  \
My research interests include visual cognition, science of learning, and computational modeling.\
More specifically, I am interested in how multimodal information can guide people's eye movement strategies when doing various tasks (e.g., multimedia learning, emotion recognition, and face recognition), and the neural representations underlying those effects. I am also interested in simulating human cognition using computational modeling to better understand the patterns and mechanisms of human behaviors.
